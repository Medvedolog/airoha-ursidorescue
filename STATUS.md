# UrsidoRescue 0.2.0-test3

Status: **simulation PASS / HW HOLD.** Unit tests, a simulated AN7581 board and a pseudo-terminal
U-Boot pass (also with -race); nothing in 0.2.x has run on real hardware yet. First hardware runs
should be probes on a board you can afford to recover.

UART testers only: 3.3V TTL, GND/TX/RX only, never connect VCC.

## 0.2.0-test3 (review fixes before the first hardware probe)

- `ubi part` removed from the strict probe: UBI attach can write (volume auto-resize, fastmap).
  UBI geometry is parsed offline from the raw EC/VID headers; U-Boot attach is a separate
  ADVANCED mode (`--ubi-attach`, menu item A) reported as not read-only.
- Identity leak fixed: `/etc/board.json` `macaddr` values reached profile.json. A recursive
  sanitizer now cleans profile.json, the report and the draft; regression tests cover it.
- Unknown devices are passive: no idle Ctrl-C and no commands without a U-Boot/Linux banner;
  `--wake` allows one Ctrl-C and only well-known U-Boot prompts get commands.
- Internal marker lines go through fixed, tested templates (`probe/internal.go`).
- `--redact` also handles JSON identity fields and leaves binary files out of the bundle.

## 0.2.0-test2

Language choice (Русский / English) at start; `--lang ru|en` or `URSIDO_LANG`.

## 0.2.0-test1

Read-only Porting Collector (menu item 8, `probe` / `export`), ursus-profile-v1 bundles.

## Recovery

Unchanged from 0.1.1-test2: RAM FIPs for both boards are the UrsusBoot 0.1.0-alpha5-t66
RECOVERY_SAFE U-Boots (Fudan FM25S01A + FM25G02B). Hardware status: PENDING.
